## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd chat-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up Firebase project:
   - Create a new Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com).
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and choose the desired sign-in methods (e.g., email/password, Google, etc.).
   - Enable Firebase Realtime Database and set the appropriate rules for read and write access.
   - Generate a new Web API key.

5. Configure Firebase credentials:
   - Create a new file `.env` in the project root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

     ```
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
     ```

     Replace `YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc., with the corresponding values from your Firebase project.

6. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
